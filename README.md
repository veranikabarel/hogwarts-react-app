## General info
There is an app for true hogwarts fans, where you can find all information about the wizarding world. This app is a project made by me for Front End Developer course I took in WSB University. Check the demo [here](https://evening-waters-91734.herokuapp.com/).

## Technologies
* [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

## Setup
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits.You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
